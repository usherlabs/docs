# Bot Prevention

This security measure is in place to prevent Bots from jeopardising the partnership experience and to prevent spam conversion tracking.

[HCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) is used to determine whether or not the person using/visiting Usher is a bot or indeed a human.

Bots are detected in the Partner UI to ensure that Bots are not creating spam Partner accounts.

Bots are also detected during the Invite to determine whether or not the Referred User is a Bot or indeed a human.

The goal here is to maximise the probability that participants across the Usher network are indeed human.
