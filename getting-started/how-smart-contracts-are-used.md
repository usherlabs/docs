# How Smart Contracts are used

Conversions are events that determine when a referred user has become a customer/user of the Project running the Partner Program. \
Conversion events can trigger off the back of **Smart Contract** and Web events.

Rewards can be claimed by Partners based on the number of conversions they're responsible for. \
ie. If a Partner refers 100 swaps for a DeFi Protocol, and each each conversion is worth 0.001 ETH, they can claim 0.1ETH.

The size of rewards, the token that Partners are rewarded in and other Campaign Terms & Conditions are configured by the Brand upon Campaign creation.&#x20;

Campaign Terms & Conditions are stored immutably on Arweave to ensure that no participant can jeopardise Partners' efforts to support a Brand's Campaign.

The outcome is performance-based partnerships where:

* 💰 Partners are rewarded proportional to their efforts
* 🤝 The engagement is trustless and _(optionally)_ permissionless
* 👨🏽‍💻 Partners can self-onboard and manage their partnerships through [Usher's dedicated UI](../grow-your-brand/supporting-partners.md)
* 📈 Partners can support the growth of the Brand
* 💪 Brands can continue to focus on their best work.
