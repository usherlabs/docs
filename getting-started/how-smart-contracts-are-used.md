# How Smart Contracts are used

The core value proposition of Usher, and what separates Usher from other Partnerships Platforms is the fact that Usher partnerships are based on **Smart Contracts**.&#x20;

This means that:

1. Conversions which are tracked on the Brand's Web App culminate in Blockchain Transactions.
2. Transactions include allocation of rewards to Partner wallets based on tracked conversions.
3. The size of rewards, the token that Partners are rewarded in and other Campaign Terms & Conditions are configured by the Brand upon Campaign creation.&#x20;
4. Campaign Terms & Conditions are stored immutably in a Smart Contract to ensure that no participant can jeopardise Partners' efforts to support a Brand's Campaign.

The outcome is performance-based partnerships where:

* 💰 Partners are rewarded proportional to their efforts
* 🤝 The engagement is trustless and _(optionally)_ permissionless
* 👨🏽‍💻 Partners can self-onboard and manage their partnerships through [Usher's dedicated UI](../grow-your-brand/supporting-partners.md)
* 📈 Partners can support the growth of the Brand
* 💪 Brands can continue to focus on their best work.
