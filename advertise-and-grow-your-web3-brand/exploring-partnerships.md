# Exploring Partnerships

Partnerships can come in different types.&#x20;

Each type of Partner offers a unique method for supporting your Brand.

Some Partners such as Social Influencers may be best suited to support Affiliate Campaigns, whereas Sales Representatives are best suited to support Reseller Campaigns.

This article will provide a useful framework for approaching your partnership implementation to launch faster with less headache.

### Understanding your partnership program

The type of partnership program (_also known as a Campaign_) you create for your partners to engage with should be configured to align with the service said partners are supporting.

If your service offers a lot of people small value, ie. a consumer-facing service, then the Campaign created should be configured to reward a small number of valued tokens or even non-valued tokens per Referred User Conversion. This is done on the basis that Partners will be able to simply acquire many users through their efforts and therefore will be cumulatively rewarded appropriately.

For a service that offers a small number of businesses a high-value outcome, the Campaign should be configured to reward a proportionately high number of valued tokens. This type of Campaign would be created for a service, product, protocol, etc. that is business-facing, such that each new customer of said service is significant to the Brand.

Rewards allocated to partners in valued tokens can be considered commissions for their effort.

Ultimately, the decision is up to the Brand on how to configure the Campaign.&#x20;
