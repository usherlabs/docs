# Start a Campaign

Head over to the [Campaign Onboarding Form](https://pages.usher.so/start-a-campaign/), and submit your Campaign Terms, Details and Profile.

If you're interested in starting a campaign but would prefer a demo and to be proposed a campaign configuration, [register your interest](https://pages.usher.so/register-interest/)!

{% hint style="info" %}
We're beginning our Company journey by manually creating Campaigns on behalf of Web3 Brands.&#x20;

Once our technology matures, we will release Open Source libraries and UI dedicated to Brands enabling more intuitive & decentralised Campaign management
{% endhint %}

### Learning about Campaigns?

We advise reviewing [the Campaign Object](the-campaign-object.md) to ensure that you are completely aware of all the settings configurable for your Campaign.

A video guiding you through the Campaign Object and the Onboarding Form has also been prepared here:
