# Start a Campaign

Campaigns can be created using the [Usher Programs CLI](https://github.com/usherlabs/programs/tree/main/packages/cli).&#x20;

This does require technical expertise on the Terminal and with NPM.



If you're interested in starting a campaign but would prefer a demo and to be proposed a campaign configuration by the Usher Team, [register your interest](https://pages.usher.so/register-interest/)!

### Learning about Campaigns?

We advise reviewing [the Campaign Object](the-campaign-object.md) to ensure that you are completely aware of all the settings configurable for your Campaign.

A video guiding you through the Campaign Object and the Onboarding Form has also been prepared here:

We hope this fully equips you with an understanding of how Usher Campaigns work, however, if you require support, do not hesitate to reach out to the Usher [Discord Server](https://go.usher.so/discord)!
