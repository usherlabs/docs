# Testing your Integration

To test your integration of UsherJS, be sure to configure Usher to use Staging and then use one of the Test Campaigns over at the [Usher Staging Environment](https://app.staging.usher.so/)!

```javascript
// configured to use https://app.staging.usher.so
const usher = Usher({ staging: true });

```

[A Campaign has already been configured](https://app.staging.usher.so/campaign/arweave/ida4Pebl2uULdI\_rN8waEw65mVH9uIFTY1JyeZt1PBM) with a Destination URL of [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)&#x20;

This means that when this Invite Link is used, a redirect to [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) will take place.

To get started on this Staging Campaign, connect a wallet and Start a Partnership!

All Partnerships submitted to this Staging Environment are managed on the [Ceramic Testnet](https://developers.ceramic.network/run/nodes/available/).
